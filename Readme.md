when trying to run this website please cd into the server side and in the terminal write npm install, once all the dependencies are installed you must write npm  start, this will then start the backend.

the same process must be followed for the client side, from the root folder cd into the client folder, then in the terminal type npm start this should then connect and this will also connect to the server side folder. 

When the application is open right click so you can inspect the page and go to the console, this will allow you to see anything that is happening on the website, you will also be able to see if the details of a user has gone through to the database
